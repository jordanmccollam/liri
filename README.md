# LIRI (Node.js Bot)
#### Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

---

## Overview
LIRI is basically a overly simplified version of SIRI. You can "concert-this" and LIRI will give you information on a specified artist's upcoming concerts. You can "movie-this" and LIRI will provide the details on a specific movie. And you get the picture ;)

## Purpose
Although LIRI is neat and could be helpful, LIRI may not be the most practical. The actual purpose of LIRI is to demonstrate my skills and knowledge in Node.js.
